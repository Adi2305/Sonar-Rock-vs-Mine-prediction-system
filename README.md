# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-system
A complete ML-based Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction System implemented using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. This project analyzes 60-frequency sonar readings and predicts whether the detected object is a Rock or a Mine using a trained classification model and a fully interactive Streamlit user interface for real-time prediction.
🎯 Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction System (ML + Streamlit App)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning–based prediction system that classifies whether an object detected by sonar is a Rock or a Mine.
It uses a trained ML model on the Sonar Dataset and provides real-time predictions through an interactive Streamlit web application.

The system is designed as a minor project for academic purposes and demonstrates:
✔ Data preprocessing
✔ Logistic Regression / SVM / Random Forest (your chosen model)
✔ Model evaluation
✔ Deployment through Streamlit
✔ Clean and user-friendly UI
