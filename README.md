# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-system
A complete ML-based Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction System implemented using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. This project analyzes 60-frequency sonar readings and predicts whether the detected object is a Rock or a Mine using a trained classification model and a fully interactive Streamlit user interface for real-time prediction.
